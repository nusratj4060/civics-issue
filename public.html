  The September 2019 climate strikes, also known as the Global Week for Future, were a series of international strikes and protests to demand action be taken to address climate change, which took place from 20â€“27 September.

  The event is one of the largest climate mobilisations in US history. Over 1,000 strike events were planned in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia. The New York City school system, with more than one million students, gave permission for youth to skip school for the day to participate in the strike; the Boston school district followed suit, with Chicago's Department of Education announcing they would not mark students absent if they returned after the strike. Several school districts in the D.C. metropolitan area also excused students to strike with parental permission.
